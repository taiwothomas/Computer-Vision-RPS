This is a rock-paper-scissors game that takes user input using a computer vision model.
The model was developed using teachable machines online at https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train
This helps create a machine learning model that can be downloaded locally.

This model is deployed by running RPS_solution.py within a virtual conda environment with the following dependencies installed via pip:
opencv-python, tensorflow and ipykernel.

The game logic is written in manual_rps.py containing functions for the user and computer input, and the game and winner logic.
